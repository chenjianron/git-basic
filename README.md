# Git Basics
This practice will help you get comfortable with basic git operations: making changes and publishing them.

We will learn the following git operations:

- `add` changes to the staging area
- `commit` changes
- `push` local commits to publish them to GitHub
- `pull` changes from the remote repository
- 'branch' create a new branch named "branch-1" and push to Github

Other useful commands to see what is going on the git repository:

- `status`
- `log`

## Exercises

- [ ] Fork this repo
- [ ] Clone this repo
- [ ] Update the README: add some lines to the end and push them to GitHub
- [ ] Create a new file called `newfile.txt`, add some contents to it and push it to GitHub
- [ ] Update newfile.txt and push the changes to GitHub
- [ ] Open the repository on GitHub and make changes to `newfile.txt`
- [ ] Pull the changes to your local repository
- [ ] Create a new branch named "branch-1" and push to Github

## Practice Output 
1. Your repo url in Github
2. Your answer for What is the difference between `add`, `commit`, and `push`?

// Jarrell(陈坚镕)修改过此文件, 以下是git 命令中add, commit , push的不同


git add
将自己的修改提交到缓存中，可以理解为从生产环境把产品放在推车上，还没有进入本地仓库
git commit
将缓存修改过的文件提交到本地仓库中， 可以理解为把推车上的产品推送进入本地仓库中
git push
将本地仓库的修改提交到远程仓库上
